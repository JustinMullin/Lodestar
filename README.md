Lodestar is a simple IntelliJ color theme I created after hunting unsuccessfully for something that fit my 
tastes.  It's heavily inspired by the quite wonderful BlueForest theme 
(http://www.decodified.com/misc/2011/06/15/blueforest-a-dark-color-scheme-for-intellij-idea.html), though 
not based on it.  I've only configured colors for languages I personally use.  Feel free to use and modify as you wish.
